        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description1">This shepherd's pie is just like the one my mom used to make, but it's made with vegan ingredients.
            All amounts are approximate and can be altered to your tastes.</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegan cream cheese substitute (such as Tofutti)</li>

        <h3>Bottom layer</h3>

        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package vegetarian ground beef substitute</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar-style soy cheese</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li> Place potatoes in a pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
            Turn the heat to medium-low, and boil potatoes until tender, about 25 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li> Stir vegan mayonnaise, soy milk, olive oil, vegan cream cheese, and salt into potatoes, and mash with a potato masher until smooth and fluffy.
            Set mashed potatoes aside.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li> Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir onion, carrots, celery, frozen peas, and tomato until softened, about 10 minutes.
            Stir in Italian seasoning, garlic, and pepper</li>
        <li> Reduce the heat to medium-low, and crumble vegetarian ground beef substitute into the skillet with vegetables.
            Cook and stir, breaking up the meat substitute, until the mixture is hot, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> Spread vegetarian meat substitute mixture into the bottom of the baking dish, and top with prepared mashed potatoes, smoothing them into an even layer.
            Sprinkle potatoes with shredded soy cheese.</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and slightly browned and the casserole is hot, about 20 minutes.</li>  
       </ol>
